Task1 
To precisely match the functionality of switch, the if must use a strict comparison '==='.

For given strings though, a simple '==' works too.

if(browser == 'Edge') {
  alert("You've got the Edge!");
} else if (browser == 'Chrome'
 || browser == 'Firefox'
 || browser == 'Safari'
 || browser == 'Opera') {
  alert( 'Okay we support these browsers too' );
} else {
  alert( 'We hope that this page looks ok!' );
}
Please note: the construct browser == 'Chrome' || browser == 'Firefox' … is split into multiple lines for better readability.

But the switch construct is still cleaner and more descriptive.


Task2 

The first two checks turn into two case. The third check is split into two cases:

let a = +prompt('a?', '');

switch (a) {
  case 0:
    alert( 0 );
    break;

  case 1:
    alert( 1 );
    break;

  case 2:
  case 3:
    alert( '2,3' );
    break;
}
Please note: the break at the bottom is not required. But we put it to make the code future-proof.

In the future, there is a chance that we’d want to add one more case, for example case 4. And if we forget to add a break before it, at the end of case 3, there will be an error. So that’s a kind of self-insurance.
